		<description>Great summary Phil, and glad you had an amazing time. The Contractually team&#039;s happy to get behind your epic weekend.
Too many points of congruency made me smile while reading this... I grew up in Penticton, so always consider the Okanagan home. Really nice seeing signs of life beyond wine, beaches, and fruit stands!
As one of the organizers of Start-up Weekend Vancouver (Nov. 2011), it was a no brainer to support the Kelowna team... 
Your Twitter project resonates too... given that I managed to enjoy a little &quot;success&quot; with Mentionmapp.
Cheers for now</description>

		<description>Great post Phil.
Nice to read about it from a participant&#039;s point of view...and a non-local at that!

It was my first Startup weekend, and I thought it was a really successful, fun, co-operative event. 

I was the one taking pics on Sat &amp; Sun...they will be posted in an album called &quot;Startup Weekend Kelowna 2012&quot; on my Facebook fan page:
