		<description>Hi Jiaxiaolei,

Thanks for the comment on my blog post. I saw your follow-up post and was glad you were also able to fire up the Tornado Chat Demo app!

Yes, I missed a step. The &quot;stackato target&quot; command. Well spotted! I&#039;ll update the post accordingly.

Thanks,
Phil</description>

		<description>hi, phil:

I read your words about stackato in python-tornado groups, and according to your gudiance I finished a server in  ~/src/stackato-samples/python of my own computer. you can find it in &quot;http://jia-tornado-chat.sandbox.activestate.com/&quot;

A couple advises may be provided as follows:


1: when you try to login, the default url is &quot;https://api.stackato.local&quot;, so :

$ stackato login
Attempting login to [https://api.stackato.local]
Email: jiaxiaolei19871112@gmail.com
Password: ****************
Cannot access target (couldn&#039;t open socket: host is unreachable (Name or service not known)

In my view, some description like below should be appeared in your blog, do you think so ? :D

$ stackato target  https://api.sandbox.activestate.com
Successfully targeted to [https://api.sandbox.activestate.com]


2：Use the tornado-chat-mongo, I push my app in ActiveState. You can see in the url http://jia-tornado-chat.sandbox.activestate.com/
okay, compared with your blog,  it&#039;s ugly!
so, can you tell me what did you do about the blog we were watching ？
Any response will be welcome!</description>
