		<description>Yes, I agree with Cas, and I would add to this that cloud computing is popular right now not only because it is useful (which is true) but because it&#039;s the perfect model for private corporations. It gets good advertisement among the masters and this is trickled down to people.

That said, I don&#039;t see any major incompatibility between cloud computing models and peer2peer models like what D* tries to achieve. First, I believe most people will host their data on the Diaspora main server. Some people will host it on the server of an organization they trust. And second, D* will try to make running your own server super easy / user-friendly. Yeah, the problem is that my profile would then be offline when my laptop is shut down, so I believe there should also be the possibility for people to choose to cache/mirror their files on many servers (eg. some of their D* friends).</description>

		<description>Thanks for the interesting arguments, Phil. I can see the logic in your line of thoughts, but I disagree fundamentally with your key assumption. Decentralization is a huge trend in all areas of society and human life on earth. For example, the energy question. It doesn&#039;t take a college degree to be able to see we&#039;ve totally reached the end of centralized energy supply and we&#039;ll see energy production on a community and even private level taking over in the very near future. It&#039;s actually already happening. The same goes for the production of food. If you watch movies like &quot;Food Inc.&quot;, it&#039;s very clear private households are going to produce more and more of their own food.

Why would a trend like that stop when it comes to virtual social networks? I&#039;m not saying FB is going away in the near future, but I do think there&#039;s grass-roots growing also in the social network landscape. Diaspora looks like the perfect tool to me for community-driven, global-thinking and local-acting networks of people helping each other in their neighborhoods. The hacked Amazon cloud, just like Fukushima, just like Tunesia and Egypt, has proven how vulnerable centralized conglomerates of power, energy or data are. They won&#039;t disappear very soon, but people will be looking for alternative. Diaspora to me is one as the pod I&#039;m on can be hosted by the geek right around the corner in my neighborhood. Think it through.</description>

		<description>yup.  mom doesn&#039;t want to *think* about how this stuff works, they just want it to work.  

sure, sandbox our stuff in the cloud, so geeks like me can take the time to manage, delete, disable, disconnect and whatever I want with my stuff, but forcing everyone to manage it on that level just won&#039;t work.

I can&#039;t imagine many startups can take on the 8,000,000 lb gorilla that is facebook and actually make waves, but if its interesting enough and gets enough press, normals may actually start consider the privacy issues at play...</description>
