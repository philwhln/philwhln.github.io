		<description>The buggy flash is a known problem. Google just released an update. Probably fixed it. I read something about flash video bug fixes in the changelog.</description>

		<description>Hi Ramirek,&lt;br/&gt;I&#039;ve been steering clear of Vista myself as it&#039;s been a headache helping friends out who have it.&lt;br/&gt;Are you running Parallels?&lt;br/&gt;My advice who be making sure you have the latest and greatest version of Flash installed. If in doubt install the one for Vista from Adobe&#039;s website.&lt;br/&gt;Cheers,&lt;br/&gt;Phil</description>
