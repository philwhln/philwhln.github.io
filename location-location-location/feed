		<description>Thanks for the link Jerome. It does seem inevitable that the big guys will own the raw data on this space, just as Google, and now Microsoft, have owned maps. FourSquare have a lot of momentum, but then it&#039;s easy for the big guys to simply buy them up. Twitter, in the micro-blogging space, managed to remain un-acquired and are now classed as one of the big players. It seems a little sad that it has to be this way and independent developers ultimately have to be reliant on a Google or Microsoft for their data, even if they were in the game early on.</description>

		<description>I don&#039;t have answers to any of the questions you have asked, but something tangential to your thoughts on the topic is written up quite well in this article &quot;Location-based check-in data on its way to becoming a commodity&quot; - http://venturebeat.com/2010/08/12/location-based-check-in-data-on-its-way-to-becoming-a-commodity</description>
