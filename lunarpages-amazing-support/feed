		<description>I think writing this blog post jinxed me, because since I wrote this I&#039;ve had may problems with Lunarpages due to lots of Perl modules being uninstalled on my server and different areas of my website falling over. I&#039;m now trying &lt;a HREF=&quot;http://www.dreamhost.com/rewards.cgi?philwhln&quot; REL=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Dreamhost&lt;/a&gt;, which I&#039;ve heard is not great support, but the package they offer is pretty incredible.</description>
