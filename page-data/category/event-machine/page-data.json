In part 1 of this series on Ruby's EventMachine I discussed the benefits of event-based programming in general. I am a big fan of event-based programming, as you will see in these posts, but I wanted to flip the coin over and look at one of the down-sides of event-based programming.","category":"EventMachine","title":"Ruby’s EventMachine – Part 2 : Asynchronous != Faster"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"categorySlug":"/category/event-machine/","slug":"/rubys-eventmachine-part-1-event-based-programming"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2012-09-14T15:19:00-07:00","description":"In this first post, of a series on Ruby's EventMachine, I will introduce EventMachine and explain why event-based programming is good for your wallet. EventMachine, which just turned 1.0.0 this week, is more than just a gem, it is a new paradigm for many Ruby programmers and is not always easy to just drop into your existing stack.
