Also, skill-sets between developers do not always line up. The key phrase is “ship it!” whether it is good, bad, ugly or broken. The clock is ticking.","category":"Startups","title":"54 Hours In The Okanagan Building A Startup"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"categorySlug":"/category/startups/","slug":"/summifys-technology-examined"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2011-03-07T02:11:00-08:00","description":"In this post I will look at the technology infrastructure behind Summify.com, a website that strives to make our lives easier and helps us deal with the information overload we all experience every time we sit down at our computers. Summify has aggregated over 200 million stories from the web and serves them up on-demand through a series of different mediums.

Although, in the books I've read, this pearl of wisdom is phrased a little differently. The way to build a successful business is to help as many people as you can. Apparently, the cash will follow, if you concentrate on the helping part. The number of people you help is also important. The more people you help, the better. For instance, Facebook helps 250 million people per day, whereas Google only helps around 90 million people per day. Helping all those people has become very profitable for these two companies and many more. It's all about changing the focus from how do I make money to how do I help more people.","category":"Startups","title":"Find The Road To Your Happiness By Helping Others"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"categorySlug":"/category/startups/","slug":"/great-and-real-customer-service"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2010-10-05T21:20:00-07:00","description":"Customer service has been on my mind recently.
