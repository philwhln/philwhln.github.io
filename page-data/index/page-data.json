In part 1 of this series on Ruby's EventMachine I discussed the benefits of event-based programming in general. I am a big fan of event-based programming, as you will see in these posts, but I wanted to flip the coin over and look at one of the down-sides of event-based programming.","socialImage":null}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/rubys-eventmachine-part-1-event-based-programming","categorySlug":"/category/event-machine/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Ruby’s EventMachine – Part 1 : Event-based Programming","date":"2012-09-14T15:19:00-07:00","category":"EventMachine","description":"In this first post, of a series on Ruby's EventMachine, I will introduce EventMachine and explain why event-based programming is good for your wallet.
