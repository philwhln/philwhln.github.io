The experience should be of the technologies you are using, rather than what the data is. Certain datasets pair better with certain technologies. Simulating the data can be another approach. You just need a clever way of generating and randomizing your fake data. Thirdly, you can use a hybrid approach. Take real data and replay it on a loop, randomizing it as it goes through.

Although, in the books I've read, this pearl of wisdom is phrased a little differently. The way to build a successful business is to help as many people as you can. Apparently, the cash will follow, if you concentrate on the helping part. The number of people you help is also important. The more people you help, the better. For instance, Facebook helps 250 million people per day, whereas Google only helps around 90 million people per day. Helping all those people has become very profitable for these two companies and many more. It's all about changing the focus from how do I make money to how do I help more people.","socialImage":{"publicURL":{"publicURL":"/static/aa5e4b32b1882025a349f45e5bd43480/help_others_sq.jpg"}}}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/highchart-vs-flot-js-comparing-javascript-graphing-engines","categorySlug":"/category/software-engineering/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Highchart Vs Flot.js – Comparing JavaScript Graphing Engines ","date":"2010-12-03T14:55:00-08:00","category":"Software Engineering","description":"In previous projects at MailChannels I have used Flot.js for graphing.
