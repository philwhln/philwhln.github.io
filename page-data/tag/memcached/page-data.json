In part 1 of this series on Ruby's EventMachine I discussed the benefits of event-based programming in general. I am a big fan of event-based programming, as you will see in these posts, but I wanted to flip the coin over and look at one of the down-sides of event-based programming."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/geohash-intro","categorySlug":"/category/geospatial/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Geohash Intro","date":"2011-12-15T23:53:00-08:00","category":"Geospatial","description":"Geohashing is a simple way to encode latitude and longitude and grouping nearby points on the globe with varying resolutions.
