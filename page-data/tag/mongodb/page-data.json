Summify has aggregated over 200 million stories from the web and serves them up on-demand through a series of different mediums. The website uses Tornado to push real-time updates out to the users and they have developed over a dozen backend systems, some of which I will cover in this blog post."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/sqlshell-a-cross-database-sql-tool-with-nosql-potential","categorySlug":"/category/dev-ops/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"SQLShell.

The experience should be of the technologies you are using, rather than what the data is. Certain datasets pair better with certain technologies. Simulating the data can be another approach. You just need a clever way of generating and randomizing your fake data. Thirdly, you can use a hybrid approach. Take real data and replay it on a loop, randomizing it as it goes through. Simulating the Twitter fire-hose should not be too hard, should it?"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"mongodb","currentPage":0,"postsLimit":16,"postsOffset":0,"prevPagePath":"/tag/mongodb","nextPagePath":"/tag/mongodb/page/1","hasPrevPage":false,"hasNextPage":false}},"staticQueryHashes":["251939775","3942705351","401334301"]}
