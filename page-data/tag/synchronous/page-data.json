In part 1 of this series on Ruby's EventMachine I discussed the benefits of event-based programming in general. I am a big fan of event-based programming, as you will see in these posts, but I wanted to flip the coin over and look at one of the down-sides of event-based programming."}}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"synchronous","currentPage":0,"postsLimit":16,"postsOffset":0,"prevPagePath":"/tag/synchronous","nextPagePath":"/tag/synchronous/page/1","hasPrevPage":false,"hasNextPage":false}},"staticQueryHashes":["251939775","3942705351","401334301"]}
