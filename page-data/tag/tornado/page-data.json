In part 1 of this series on Ruby's EventMachine I discussed the benefits of event-based programming in general. I am a big fan of event-based programming, as you will see in these posts, but I wanted to flip the coin over and look at one of the down-sides of event-based programming."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/rubys-eventmachine-part-1-event-based-programming","categorySlug":"/category/event-machine/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Ruby’s EventMachine – Part 1 : Event-based Programming","date":"2012-09-14T15:19:00-07:00","category":"EventMachine","description":"In this first post, of a series on Ruby's EventMachine, I will introduce EventMachine and explain why event-based programming is good for your wallet. EventMachine, which just turned 1.0.0 this week, is more than just a gem, it is a new paradigm for many Ruby programmers and is not always easy to just drop into your existing stack. As the name suggests, it gives you event-based programming."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/54-hours-in-the-okanagan-building-a-startup","categorySlug":"/category/startups/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"54 Hours In The Okanagan Building A Startup","date":"2012-03-05T18:04:00-08:00","category":"Startups","description":"Remember, Startup Weekend equates to about 21 hours of development time and that includes brainstorming, planning, talking to mentors, other meetings, eating and a bit of fun. Also, skill-sets between developers do not always line up. The key phrase is “ship it!” whether it is good, bad, ugly or broken.
