You will not need to ssh into the cluster, as all tasks are run from your local machine. Below I am using my MacBook Pro as my local machine, but the steps I have provided should be reproducible on other platforms running bash and Java."}}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"whirr","currentPage":0,"postsLimit":16,"postsOffset":0,"prevPagePath":"/tag/whirr","nextPagePath":"/tag/whirr/page/1","hasPrevPage":false,"hasNextPage":false}},"staticQueryHashes":["251939775","3942705351","401334301"]}
