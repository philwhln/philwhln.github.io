We have been developing a high performance SMTP proxy that can scale to handle tens of thousands of connections per second on each machine, even with pretty standard hardware.</p>\n<p>For the past 18 months I’ve moved from working on the SMTP proxy to working on our other systems, all of which make use of the data we collect from each connection. It’s a fair amount of data and it can be up to 2Kb in size for each connection. Our servers receive approximately 1000 of these pieces of data per second, which is fairly sustained due to our global distribution of customers. If you compare that to <a href=\"https://mashable.com/2010/06/25/tps-record/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Twitter’s peak of 3,283 tweets per second</a> (maximum of 140 characters), you can see it’s not a small amount of data that we are dealing with here.</p>\n<p>So what do we do with this data? We have a real-time global reputation network of IP addresses that send email. We use this is identify good and bad senders. The bad being spambots. We also pump this data into our custom-built distributed search engine, built using Apache Lucene, which is no small task when we aim to get search results live within 30 seconds of the connection taking place. This is close enough to real-time for our purposes.</p>\n<p>I recently set out to scientifically prove the benefits of throttling, which is our technology for slowing down connections in order to detect spambots, who are kind enough to disconnect quite quickly when they see a slow connection. Due to the nature of the data we had, I needed to work with a long range of data to show evidence that an IP that appeared on Spamhaus had previously been throttled and disconnected, and then measure the duration until it appeared on Spamhaus. I set a job to pre-process a selected set of customers data and arbitrarily decided 66 days would be a good amount to process, as this was 2 months plus a little breathing room. I knew from my experience it was possible that it might take 2 months for a bad IP to be picked up by Spamhaus.</p>\n<p>I will not go into the details of the results here, as they can be found on the MailChannels blog post entitled <a href=\"https://blog.mailchannels.com/2010/09/spamhaus-vs-throttling\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Comparing Spamhaus with Proactive Connection Throttling</a>, but the cool things about this was the amount of data that needed to be processed. I extracted 28,204,693 distinct IPs, some of which were seen over million times in this data set. Here the graph of the results I found. I thought the logarithmic graph looked perfect.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 869px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/5d7274d5ec0208e6d1d013f1a1738735/2b2c6/spamhaus_detection_graph.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 54.166666666666664%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAALCAYAAAB/Ca1DAAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAABM0lEQVQoz4VSi26EIBD0//+xbZr6vFPUE+QlzrFYqeQ8S7IR2d1hdoZs6HvkeQ5azrnrWFfAarDbADaZ0LPS2WFly7JAzHNI/BdYHap6RHXnMHY5B1RKoiyryPAMyLmt6TZo9PyX2Ztaz9CCc3HNDCtmoSIYXUCX7wwTQCUl6rp+y3BrXMGljfk/XdNxo4ac8wt2gDLOm2AD8FGGj2r2hv6gKIoQZG5mjEHbtqe67fuKKWgPCjo/MF98jbU2icx6wN4/HSITiyM7h7s3YpI2apdK8boyQh2G4SVBcE03o3vs7y3NHwETU6hyfHA/lkTRTPguenxVEz7LEQ0TMFpDKQXpzdtChX+jTRhx13n/ZrSRvkBIg1lSsw5N1Kz9GxVCgE9TmIKkIb27joExFowYxzEBfAJZcmAePW+ICgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg=='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <picture>\n        <source\n          srcset=\"/static/5d7274d5ec0208e6d1d013f1a1738735/8ac56/spamhaus_detection_graph.webp 240w,\n/static/5d7274d5ec0208e6d1d013f1a1738735/d3be9/spamhaus_detection_graph.webp 480w,\n/static/5d7274d5ec0208e6d1d013f1a1738735/c3694/spamhaus_detection_graph.webp 869w\"\n          sizes=\"(max-width: 869px) 100vw, 869px\"\n          type=\"image/webp\"\n        />\n        <source\n          srcset=\"/static/5d7274d5ec0208e6d1d013f1a1738735/8ff5a/spamhaus_detection_graph.png 240w,\n/static/5d7274d5ec0208e6d1d013f1a1738735/e85cb/spamhaus_detection_graph.png 480w,\n/static/5d7274d5ec0208e6d1d013f1a1738735/2b2c6/spamhaus_detection_graph.png 869w\"\n          sizes=\"(max-width: 869px) 100vw, 869px\"\n          type=\"image/png\"\n        />\n        <img\n          class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n          src=\"/static/5d7274d5ec0208e6d1d013f1a1738735/2b2c6/spamhaus_detection_graph.png\"\n          alt=\"spamhaus detection graph\"\n          title=\"spamhaus detection graph\"\n          loading=\"lazy\"\n          style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        />\n      </picture>\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p><em>Graph taken from the MailChannels analysis of Spamhaus Vs Throttling</em></p>\n<p>Have you worked with large amounts of data that does not get the same fanfare attention as the Twitter firehose by bloggers such as Mashable?

Actually, I&#x2019;ve recently moved on from MailChannels to start my own tech company, so I&#x2019;m not trying to sell the technology right now. Without getting into too much detail, slowing connections targets the economics of sending spam. Spammers have to get an enormous amount of spam out to get enough people to click on the links or buy of the controversial pharmaceuticals that they are selling. Their click-through-rate is incredibly small. Even if they know you are slowing them down, they do not have the time to wait around. It&#x2019;s better for them to move onto the next guy.</p>\n            <p>My approach to starting a tech company is getting things up and running as quickly as possible. Use the languages and tools that you are most comfortable with. You do not need to scale until you are successful, at which point it&#x2019;s easier to rewrite things in a more scalable way, or hire somebody else who knows how to do it, and concentrate on putting out the other fires in your successful business. You&#x2019;ll probably be rewriting things anyway as the product or service evolves and you learn more about the need that you are addressing. When you make things scalable you lock yourself into certain choices that limits your ability to be dynamic.</p>\n          </div>\n          <!-- .comment-text -->\n        </li>\n        <!-- .comment -->\n      </ol>\n    </li>\n    <!-- .comment -->\n    <li id=\"comment-43\" class=\"comment even thread-odd thread-alt depth-1 comment reader\">\n      <img alt=\"Alan\" src=\"https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/ebd3cf4b0b5fd724f593e5d47c866d6e?s=80&amp;d=https%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D80&amp;r=PG\" class=\"avatar avatar-80 photo\" height=\"80\" width=\"80\">\n      <div class=\"comment-meta comment-meta-data\">\n        <div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n          <cite class=\"fn\" title=\"https://alan.blog-city.com/\">Alan</cite>\n        </div>\n        <!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n        <abbr class=\"comment-date\" title=\"Friday, September 24th, 2010, 4:08 pm\">September 24, 2010</abbr> at <abbr class=\"comment-time\" title=\"Friday, September 24th, 2010, 4:08 pm\">4:08 pm</abbr>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"comment-text\">\n        <p>@Phil excellent post.

The Bloom Filter does sound like a great tool, that I&#x2019;ve not come across before. I will have to read up on it.</p>\n            <p>In this case, where the goal is to build concrete statistics, I think the false-positive aspect of the Bloom Filter would have affected the results. Even if it was ever so slightly, I would have felt uncomfortable publishing them and referring to somebody else&#x2019;s technology (Spamhaus in this case) where I knew there may be a slight inaccuracy.</p>\n            <p>I see that the Bloom Filter addresses memory consumption. Since I had so much data, memory was not an issue. That&#x2019;s sounds backwards and it is. Since the data cannot possibly fit into a machine memory, I used several technics I discovered from working with Hadoop. Basically streaming data to and from disk in the most efficient way, performing several transformations of the data and writing the data to disk to divide, organise, sort, merge and conquer. I think the peak memory I used was far less than I had on the machine, and this was generally highest when sorting the individual files.</p>\n            <p>I&#x2019;m considering writing a blog post on the details of how I tackled this data, as this blog post proved to be quite popular. Would that be something you would be interested in?</p>\n          </div>\n          <!-- .comment-text -->\n        </li>\n        <!-- .comment -->\n      </ol>\n    </li>\n    <!-- .comment -->\n    <li id=\"comment-52\" class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1 comment reader\">\n      <img alt=\"Antti Siira\" src=\"https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/cd4b8031f3ade684376d8b7985728dbd?s=80&amp;d=https%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D80&amp;r=PG\" class=\"avatar avatar-80 photo\" height=\"80\" width=\"80\">\n      <div class=\"comment-meta comment-meta-data\">\n        <div class=\"comment-author vcard\">\n          <cite class=\"fn\">Antti Siira</cite>\n        </div>\n        <!-- .comment-author .vcard -->\n        <abbr class=\"comment-date\" title=\"Saturday, September 25th, 2010, 11:16 pm\">September 25, 2010</abbr> at <abbr class=\"comment-time\" title=\"Saturday, September 25th, 2010, 11:16 pm\">11:16 pm</abbr></div>\n      <div class=\"comment-text\">\n        <p>If you want to see bloom filters used in spam processing, you could check out gross[1] that uses them for greylisting.
