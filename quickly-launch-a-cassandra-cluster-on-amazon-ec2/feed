		<description>Hi Chandra,

You will be charged for any resources you use on Amazon EC2. They do have a &quot;free tier&quot;, but you will unlikely be able to set up a cluster on this. See http://aws.amazon.com/free/faqs/

Thanks,
Phil</description>

		<description>Few Question.

* If i setup Cassandra in EC2 cloud, I will be charged for using the cloud?
* I tried to register in Amazon cloud , they says it&#039;s free but ask for credit card details, and i am sure  they would be charging for bandwidth usages.

Thanks Chandra</description>

		<description>HI,

Where do we specify hostname or ipaddress of cluster machine when installing cluster using whirr?

Can we install hadoop stable version or hadoop-2.0.0-alpha version using whirr

Should we use whirr for cluster installation at production?

regards,
rashmi</description>

		<description>Thanks for the excellent post.  I tried setting up the cluster and while it did create three ec2 instances, Cassandra was not started on any of them.  The version installed was 6.x as well.  Do you have any further details on how to make sure Cassandra starts on each node?  Also, I would like to completely control which version of Cassandra gets installed on the nodes.  Any thoughts about how to do that?  Ideally I would like to control what base version of Linux is used as well.

Thanks!</description>
