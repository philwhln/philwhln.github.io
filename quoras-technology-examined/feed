		<description>Good point, Alex. The WHEN will have to wait for another post. Stay tuned.

It&#039;s important to understand that the co-founders at Quora understand the technologies they are using very well. They planned for scaling and performance before they built their tools and architecture. They understand MySQL very well and how they can use it as the basis for a scalable data-store. They seem to also know when the limitations of this architecture will be reached and I have no doubts that they have plans in place for migrating the architecture, where necessary, to different technologies. That said, they will likely encounter some unique challenges in scaling that others have not encountered before. This is due to the unique way that they have created Quora. Friendfeed is the closest website structure I can think of off the top of my head, but I expect Quora to take the scaling to a whole new level. LiveNode and webnode2 show that they are not affraid of building their own solution where one does not exist. The question might not be WHEN to move to a NoSQL solution (if that is your question), but WHEN to build your own NoSQL solution that uniquely addresses your scaling challenges.</description>

		<description>Yes, that&#039;s right. The web-browser keeps the connection with the server alive using HTTP keep-alive.</description>

		<description>&lt;blockquote&gt;Quora uses persistent connections. A HTTP connection is established with the server when you start typing the search query. This connection is kept open and further requests are made on this same open connection. The connection will terminate (times-out) if not used for 60 seconds. If a connection times-out then a new connection is established when typing begins.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By &quot;persistent connections&quot;, do you mean HTTP keep-alive (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keepalive)?</description>

		<description>I must admit I too stopped to ponder why Quora was not using a nosql database -- but then I thought &quot;Hey, whatever flies your kite.&quot;

Also, thank you for the further reading suggestions!</description>

		<description>I must smile a little about the surprised reactions on the scale-at-the-application thing. This is so commonly used in the industry long before shared caches came around. In Telecoms billing software for example,  especially software that makes the weird real-time calculation for prepaid subscribers, you often can see them scale the load by the subscribers&#039; MSISDN. This does not actually distribute the load perfectly balanced, but it&#039;s simple to implement. Each node could have its own database locally, even MySQL. Batch processes running during the less active hours of the service redistribute subscriber data if needed.</description>

		<description>Thanks Phil for this comment. I finally went back to it and break it down. This is brilliant and inspiring.

I believe we&#039;re missing something crucial: stats. Scaling up is getting easier but setting up this kind of architecture requires a lot of learning and time. So the question for us, entrepreneurs, would be WHEN since you answered to the HOW.

At how many HTTP or SQL requests per day should we start caring about details. Except the fact that NoSQL does not appear necessary before 1M users, what other milestones should we watch out to know when IT&#039;S TIME.

See U soon.</description>

		<description>Really impressive breakdown of their stack.. I thought it was php driven considering the Facebook legacy. I hope they open source their search..</description>

		<description>Very interesting! I knew that Quora was SQL, much to the disdain and surprise of the NoSQL types. 

However, as a user, I&#039;d noticed that Quora&#039;s platform seemed to be able to withstand as much abuse as I could throw at it through my undisciplined work and browsing habits. High reliability, fast, not a Chrome browser resource hog, real-time updating of information without locking out users, yet no getting hung. I&#039;ve never timed out on Quora, either. 

Of course (unless one is Robert Scoble, snark snark), there aren&#039;t many image files to contend with, nor multi-media, which are resource hogs. 

Thank you so much for this post, and for satisfying some of my curiosity. (I need to go back and re-read it carefully, there&#039;s a lot of content here).

I look forward to more!</description>
