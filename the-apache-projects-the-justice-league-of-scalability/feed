		<description>Thanks for the nice comments, Karthik. I missed Hive. I&#039;ll have to give Hive some love in a future post. I agree with you on Solr / Lucene. It can be a great alternative (or compliment) to traditional databases and even (yes &lt;em&gt;even&lt;/em&gt;) &quot;NoSQL&quot; technologies. Use-case dependent obviously.</description>

		<description>Hi Otis,

Thanks for the comment!

I updated the text yesterday for Hadoop. Does this cover roughly what you were saying?

&lt;blockquote&gt;Apache Hadoop, son of Apache Nutch and later raised under the watchful eye of Yahoo, has since become an Apache Project. Nutch is an open-source web search project built on Lucene. The component of Nutch that became Hadoop gave Nutch it’s “web-scale”.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I&#039;ll try and squeeze a mention of HDFS there too.</description>

		<description>Actually, I&#039;d say Hadoop came from Apache Nutch, where the HDFS predecessor was first created.</description>

		<description>Thanks for a great article. I&#039;m very interested in high scalability technologies, and your article gives a real useful overview.

Both Apache Solr and ActiveMQ have helped reduce development time on my projects. I&#039;d especially like to highlight the fantastic faceted search feature of Solr - that&#039;s thousands of DB &#039;select count&#039; queries saved there!

The Apache Hive project also deserves a mention in your list - it adds a query language layer of abstraction over hadoop, that makes writing map reduce jobs for data analytics easier and intuitive.</description>

		<description>Thanks for those two corrections, Hector. Do you have any more information on what Facebook is now using Cassandra for?</description>

		<description>Thanks for the clarification, Allen. Based on your comments and Doug Cutting&#039;s &quot;Hadoop: a brief history&quot; http://research.yahoo.com/files/cutting.pdf I have updated the text.</description>

		<description>Hi. Facebook only uses cassandra in the inbox feature, so whatever the effect of eventual consistency on cassandra, it would only be noticeable there. Also, they are not moving away from it (as it is still being used). They decided it wasn&#039;t the right fit for the new functionality they were planning.

		<description>A slight correction.

Apache Hadoop came from Apache Lucene.  Yahoo! joined the already-in-progress project, adding some much needed know-how around scale.  So great are their contributions, that it is a common misconception that Yahoo! started the project.</description>
